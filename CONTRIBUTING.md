# Contributing

I welcome any contributions or outside opinions on things that should be a focus for the development of Lythe.

Any code you make is under the MIT license.

So the single most basic rule here:

1. Don't be a dick

Everything else is just a subset of The Primary Rule. 

Some other things to note

* Assume best intentions in discussions - if something can be taken two ways where one is mean and the other isn't,
assume it is meant in the non-mean way.
